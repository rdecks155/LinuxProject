This program can be used as a personal todo list using bash coommands. 
There is an interface for simpler use and more advanced commands that can 
be run with no interface. For further instruction refer to man file. 
This program demonstrates my understanding of how to hande arguements as 
parameters and a level of proficiency in writing bash scripts.
